=head2 C<summarise ( [$term] )>

Returns a summary of this modules settings, setting C<$term> true results in
summary being coloured for terminal display

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

A list of every error and warning message that the module can generate (even
the ones that will "never happen"), with a full explanation of each problem,
one or more likely causes, and any suggested remedies.

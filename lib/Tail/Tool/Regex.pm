Tail::Tool::Regex - Base class for regex details

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Tail::Tool::Regex version 0.4.1.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Tail::Tool::Regex;

   # create a new object with a regex reference
   my $regex = Tail::Tool::Regex->new( regex => qr/^find/ );

   # if a string is passed it will be coerced into a regex reference
   $regex = Tail::Tool::Regex->new( regex => '^find' );

   # if replacement is to be done specify a replacement string
   $regex = Tail::Tool::Regex->new(
       regex   => qr/find$/,
       replace => 'found',
   );

   # if the regex is used for colouring specify the colours
   $regex = Tail::Tool::Regex->new(
       regex  => qr/find$/,
       colour => [qw/red on_green/],
   );

   # The regex can be set to being disabled initially
   $regex = Tail::Tool::Regex->new(
       regex   => qr/find/,
       enabled => 0,
   );

=head1 NAME

Tail::Tool::Plugin::Highlight - Highlights any text that matches the supplied
regular expressions.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Tail::Tool::Plugin::Highlight version 0.3.0.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Tail::Tool::Plugin::Highlight;

   # Brief but working code example(s) here showing the most common usage(s)
   # This section will be as far as many users bother reading, so make it as
   # educational and exemplary as possible.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 C<new (%params)>

Param: regex - ArrayRef - List of regular expressions that lines must match

Param: colourer - CodeRef - A sub that takes an array ref of colour
specifications as the first argument and the text to be coloured as the second
argument. The default colourer is the colored function from L<Term::ANSIColor>

=head2 C<process ($line)>

Description: Checks if the line matches any of the regular expressions supplied
then colours the matched parts and returns the changed line.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

A list of every error and warning message that the module can generate (even
the ones that will "never happen"), with a full explanation of each problem,
one or more likely causes, and any suggested remedies.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

A full explanation of any configuration system(s) used by the module, including
the names and locations of any configuration files, and the meaning of any
environment variables or properties that can be set. These descriptions must

or must be installed separately.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction with.
This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or competition for system
or program resources, or due to internal limitations of Perl (for example, many
modules that use source code filters are mutually incompatible).

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

A list of known problems with the module, together with some indication of
whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming release.

Also, a list of restrictions on the features the module does provide: data types
that cannot be handled, performance issues and the circumstances in which they
may arise, practical limitations on the size of data sets, special cases that
are not (yet) handled, etc.

The initial template usually just has:

=head1 NAME

Tail::Tool::Plugin::GroupLines - Groups real lines of a log file so that other plugins treat then as one line.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Tail::Tool::Plugin::GroupLines version 0.3.6.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Tail::Tool::Plugin::GroupLines;

   # Brief but working code example(s) here showing the most common usage(s)
   # This section will be as far as many users bother reading, so make it as
   # educational and exemplary as possible.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Groups lines together so that they are presented as one line to other plugins.
It does this by checking each real log file line and checking if it matches
regex to indicate the start of a line (or if end is true the regex matches
the end of lines).

An example of why you might want to do this:

A log file with long data dumps that span many lines may be hard to filter out
but if those lines can be grouped together then only part of the line need
match for all lines to be excluded.

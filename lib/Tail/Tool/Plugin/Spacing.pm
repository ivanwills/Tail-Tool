   my $sp = Tail::Tool::Plugin::Spacing(
       times => [ 2, 5 ],
       lines => [ 2, 5 ],
   );

   $sp->process("test\n");
   # returns ("test\n");

   ...

   # 2 seconds later
   $sp->process("test\n");

   # returns ( "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "test\n" );
   # ie 7 blank lines ( 2 lines + 5 lines )
